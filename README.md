# Project Title: DDD and Tactical Modeling Training with TypeScript

## Description

This project serves as a hands-on training platform for Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and tactical modeling, leveraging the power and flexibility of TypeScript. It's an ideal resource for developers looking to deepen their understanding of DDD principles and apply them in a practical setting. By integrating Jest for testing, SQLite for a lightweight database solution, and Sequelize as the ORM, the project offers a robust setup for experimenting with and mastering DDD concepts.

## Features

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Learn and apply DDD concepts in a structured TypeScript environment.
- **Tactical Modeling**: Gain practical experience in implementing DDD tactical patterns.
- **Jest Integration**: Write and run tests using Jest, a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- **SQLite Database**: Utilize SQLite, a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
- **Sequelize ORM**: Manage database actions with Sequelize, a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NathanaelCarauna/FC-tactical-modeling.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd FC-tactical-modeling
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Running Tests
To run tests with Jest, use the command:

## Usage
This project is structured to facilitate learning and applying DDD and tactical modeling in TypeScript. Here's how you can make the most of it:

Explore Domain Models: Check the src/domain directory to understand how domain models are structured and implemented.

Understand Persistence: Look into the src/infrastructure directory to see how the project interacts with SQLite using Sequelize.

Write Tests: Use Jest to write tests. Examples can be found in the directory.

Experiment and Modify: Feel free to modify the domain models, services, and infrastructure to test different DDD concepts and tactical patterns.
